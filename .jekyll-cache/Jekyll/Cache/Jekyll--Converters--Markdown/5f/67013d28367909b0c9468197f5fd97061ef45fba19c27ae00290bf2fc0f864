<p>After the production/assembly stage, quality control (QC) tests are performed on every sensor to validate the data quality. QAP is a quality management procedure followed during the sensor build/assembly process, whereas QC procedures are performed after the complete build procedure and before the deployment.</p>

<h4 id="objective">Objective</h4>

<p>To perform initial calibration and validate sensor data after QAP in laboratory conditions.</p>

<h4 id="methodology">Methodology</h4>

<p>Using measuring tape, mount locations are fixed at heights h1, h2, h3, h4 from the surface. The sensor is mounted at these known heights in order starting from h1 and collects data every 30 seconds at least for an hour total</p>
