<p>After the production/assembly stage, quality control (QC) tests are performed on every sensor to validate the data quality. QAP is a quality management procedure followed during the sensor build/assembly process, whereas QC procedures are performed after the complete build procedure and before the deployment.</p>

<h3 id="21-sensor-calibration-and-data-validation-testing">2.1 Sensor Calibration and Data Validation Testing</h3>

<h4 id="objective">Objective</h4>

<p>To perform initial calibration and validate sensor data after QAP in laboratory conditions.</p>

<h4 id="procedure">Procedure</h4>

<p>The mounting bracket lies on a plane higher that the sensor cone. When installed at a known height, the sensor reading is differed by an offset (h_offset) which is equal to the difference between the mount level and the sensor level.</p>

<p>Therefore when the sensor is mounted at a known height i.e when the mounting bracket is installed at a known height, the sensor reading should lie within the noise floor of the sensor and offset by the value h_offset.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using measuring tape, mount locations are fixed at heights h1, h2, h3, h4 from the surface.</li>
  <li>The sensor is mounted at these known heights in order starting from h1 and collects data every 30 seconds for at least 30 minutes, totaling at least 60 measurements.</li>
  <li>For the next 30 minutes, an object of known height is placed on the surface and measurements are recorded.</li>
  <li>The object is removed and the sensor is moved onto the next height and the process is repeated until the sensor has been tested at all the heights.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="calibration">Calibration</h4>

<p>The data collected from the sensor is used to calibrate and measure the height of the known object. Since measurement of depth is relative to another vertical elevation from a known reference point, this height of the object is a simulation of depth level.</p>

<p>At every given height, the offset is calculated and transformed into depth levels. The depth shall match the objects height.</p>

<h4 id="records">Records</h4>

<p>Calibration offsets and depth averages are recorded for every sensor along with the sensor unique identifiers shall be recorded on this google sheets for reference.</p>

<h3 id="22-noise-floor-testing">2.2 Noise floor Testing</h3>

<h4 id="objective-1">Objective</h4>

<p>The objective of this test is to perform noise floor testing of the ultrasonic sensor.</p>

<h4 id="procedure-1">Procedure</h4>

<p>Data collected from 2.1 is passed through this algorithm to test the noise floor of the sensor.</p>

<h4 id="records-1">Records</h4>

<p>Noise floor for every sensor along with the sensor unique identifiers shall be recorded on this google sheets for reference.</p>
