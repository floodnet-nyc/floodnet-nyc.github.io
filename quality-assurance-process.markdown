## General

### Purpose

The main objectives of this document are:

- Establish and execute Quality Assurance (QA) measures and procedures to meet good standards 
- Risk Assessment Process (RAP) guidelines to provide identification, evalution and control

### Scope

This Quality Assurance Process (QAP) applies to all personnel performing sensor development, assembly and validation at FloodNet.

### Roles and Responsibilities

The following table outlines the roles and responsibilities for FloodNet personnel

| FloodNet personnel          | QA Roles                                                     | QA Responsibilities                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Technical Lead              | 1. QA Manager/Advisor <br />2. Technical Lead                | 1. Manages the project and oversees the big picture<br />2. Uses strong technical skills to help the team solve technical issues |
| Sensor Engineer             | 1. QA Team Test Lead <br />2. QA Validation Specialist <br />3. QA Manual/Automation Test Engineer | 1. Provides Leadership specifically to the test team to support the test teammates and oversee test processes<br /> 2. Participate in validation of the Quality Assurance Process (QAP)<br /> 3. Develop and maintain Manual/Automated test processes |
| Graduate Research Assistant | 1. QA Manual/Automation Test Analyst <br />2. QA Tester      | 1. Develop, maintain and execute Manual/Automated test processes <br />2. Follow strict set of instructions to test or validate the product |

## Training

### Training Needs

### Training Program Implementation

## Quality Assurance Process

The Quality Assurance Process shall be followed staff responsible for performing and verifying work affecting sensor quality. 

### Quality Requirements

The Quality Requirements are classified into two categories: Hardware and Software. QAP process shall be followed on the former first, followed by the later. Software malfunction could be a result of failures in the hardware. Hence, the *QA process shall be reinitiated from the beginning upon identification of bugs in either stages to follow the QAP pipeline.*

#### Hardware

The following is the list of hardware quality requirements:

| Hardware Quality Requirements        | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| High Quality Electrical Connections | 1. The sensor's hardware must **<u>NOT</u>** have any errors in electrical connections.<br />2. High quality soldering practices |
| Free of Short-Circuits              | 1. The sensor shall have **<u>NO</u>** short-circuits<br />2. The personnel shall check for short-circuits at every stage of the assembly |
| Desired Hardware operation          | 1.  The sensor Hardware shall be functional and tested before moving onto the software stage |
| Waterproofed Sensor                 | 1. All the electrical wire connections lying **<u>inside</u>** as well as **<u>outside</u>** of the sensor shall be waterproofed using heat shrink tubing<br />2. All the external cables and electrical connections outside the sensor shall be waterproofed further either by using liquid electrical tape or silicon<br />3. The housing shall be checked for any defects or potential damage that might cause failure in waterproofing |

#### Software

Stable Sensor Operation

Sensor Accuracy within Tolerance

Good Wireless Connectivity

### Quality Assurance Stages

Stage 1: 

### Quality Assurance Evaluations

#### Hardware

#### Software

### Quality Assurance Records
