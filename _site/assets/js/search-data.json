    "content": "Of the myriad impacts that are predicted to accompany climate change, flooding is expected to have an out-sized influence on public health, infrastructure, and mobility in urban areas. In New York City, for example, sea level rise and an increase in the occurrence of high intensity rain storms (which convey large volumes of water to drains, leading to backups and overflows) have led to a dramatic increase in flood risk, particularly in low-lying and coastal neighborhoods. The physical presence of standing water on streets and sidewalks can impede mobility and restrict access to transportation. Additionally, urban flood water contains a diverse array of contaminants, including industrial and household chemicals, fuels, and sewage. Access to real-time information on flooding can improve resiliency and efficiency by allowing residents to identify navigable transportation routes and make informed decisions to avoid exposure to floodwater contaminants.

    "content": "# Real-time Flood Depth Data Quality Control ## 1.0 General ### 1.1 Background [FloodNet](floodnet.nyc) is a cooperative of communities, researchers, New York City governament agencies working to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in New York City. This project uses advanced IoT flood sensors to measure Real-time Flood Depth Data (FDD) on a city-wide scale. These sensors use [Industrial grade Ultrasonic Ranging sensors](https://www.maxbotix.com/ultrasonic_sensors/mb7389.htm) to calculate the depth data. ### 1.2 Purpose The purpose of this document is to explain the Quality Control (QC) of Real-time Flood Depth Data (FDD) at FloodNet. This manual presents series of QC procedures for FDD with real-time data as the focus. These QC procedures are written specifically to the Real-time FDD collected from the sensors based on Ultrasonic Range-finding Technology. FDD observations are collected in the streets and canals in an urban setting in real-time. The Data flow pipeline and QC tests in this document are documented and classified with the help of following references: 1. [U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System, 2021 Manual for Real-Time Quality Control of Water Level Data Version 2.1](https://doi.org/10.25923/vpsx-dc82) 2. [NWS Techniques Specification Package (TSP) 88-21-R2 (1994)](ftp://ftp.library.noaa.gov/noaa_documents.lib/NWS/NWS_TSP_88-21-R2.pdf) ## 2.0 Considerations/Limitations This section details the important considerations and limitations of the Flood Depth Data quality. ## 2.1 Ground truth Validation of Real-time Flood Depth Data To manually validate the Real-time Flood Depth Data, the FloodNet researchers have conducted a Manual Validation Experiment during the event of a flood on the July 23 at 8:30pm in {location}. Manual depth calculation is performed by manually capturing the depth readings from a standard measuring scale that has been installed on the same pole on which the sensor has been mounted. The following figure shows the comparision of manual depth captured vs Flood-Depth Data processed from the Data-pipeline. The results verify the validation of the Flood Depth Data captured by this Real-time Flood Monitoring System. ### 2.2 Sensor Deployment Considerations #### 2.2.1 Error in Pole Mount Angles Error in Light pole angles, street sign post angles #### 2.2.2 Location and Surface #### 2.2.3 Obstacles Weeds, dogs, humans, animals ### 2.3 Hardware Limitations #### 2.3.1 Accuracy of Ultrasonic Sensor #### 2.3.2 Noise Floor of Ultrasonic Sensor #### 2.3.3 Seasonal and Temperature Drift #### 2.3.4 Influence on Ultrasonic Raw measurements by external factors ### 2.4 Other Important Considerations In addition to the data quality mentioned in the manual, Quality Assurance Process (QAP) performed on sensor during assembly/production is critical to data quality. All personnel performing sensor build must follow the QAP procedure and shall comply Hardware QC checklist during the assembly/production process prior to the deployment. All sensors and measurements contains errors that are determined by hardware quality, calibration accuracy, modes of operation, and data processing and pipeline techniques. All these considereations are quantified and explained in the section 4.2 Flood Sensor QC Test description. ## 3.0 Flood Depth Data Flow Pipeline ### 3.1 Data Flow Pipeline Overview The following figure shows the overview of the Data Flow Pipeline: ![datapipeline-overview](/assets/images/data-pipeline-overview.png) The Flood Sensors transmit the raw data packets over LoRaWAN. These packets are forwarded to a The Things Network (TTN) application via LoRa Gateway. This data is further flows from the TTN into an open-source tools hosted on NYU servers. This combination of docker containers is running a load-balanced web server (NGINX), certificate authority (LetsEncrypt), data routing layer (NodeRed), a database (InfluxDB), and a dashboard platform (Grafana). When the raw data packets transmitted by the sensors from the field reach the Node-RED, Pre-Production (Laboratory), Post-Production (On-Site), and Real-Time (On-Site) testing stages are implemented. Raw as well as tested data is stored in the InfluxDB database. From there, Grafana handles all the visualization and alerting through its intuitive dashboarding platform. ### 3.2 Data Flow Pipeline Description #### 3.2.1 Flood Sensors Flood Sensors are LoRaWAN enabled end-device nodes. These nodes transmit messages wirelessly over LoRaWAN network through radio gateways using LoRa RF Modulation. These end-devices are identified using unique identifiers, which enables secure activation and administration of the device, to ensure the safe transport of packets over a private or public network and to deliver encrypted data to the Cloud. The flood sensors operate in Class A, a LoRa-based end device mode. More information on the working of LoRaWAN Class A devices can be found in [Reference 6](https://lora-developers.semtech.com/uploads/documents/files/LoRaWAN_Class_A_Devices_In_Depth_Downloadable.pdf). #### 3.2.2 LoRaWAN #### 3.2.3 LoRa Gateway #### 3.2.4 TTN #### 3.2.5 NGINX #### 3.2.6 NodeRED #### 3.2.7 InfluxDB #### 3.2.8 Grafana ### 3.3 Data Processing Methodology ## 4.0 Quality Control ### 4.1 Flood Depth Data QC Test Hierarchy The quality of the Flood Depth Data captured by the sensors is tested during three different stages: 1. **Pre-Production Testing (Laboratory) - Stage 1:** This phase of testing is the initial validation of sensor accuracy and calibration. This is carried out in controlled laboratory conditions where the most highly accurate measurements are possible. These controlled conditions include - testing at room temperature, no external factors such as sunlight, noise, wind, and humidity, obstacles, and interference. 2. **Post-Production Testing (On-Site) - Stage 2:** After the sensor installation on-site, the sensor is calibrated during the night times over a period of {fill-me-in} as {so and so- reason}. This is the reference point or the baseline which lies on the street-level. Further depending on the sensor mounting location, the possible scenarios are: - Sensor mounted on Street-Sign Post (fig a): Sidewalk is the baseline - Sensor mounted on base of the Light Pole (fig b): Sidewalk is the baseline - Sensor mounted on top of the Light Pole (fig c): Street level is the baseline 3. **Real-time Testing (On-Site) - Stage 3:** Once the baseline of the sensor has been calculated, the data is passed through the full data flow pipeline for QC. This processed and QC tested data is source for the dashboard. The following table lists the tests in the order of implemetation and hierarchy: | Category | QC Test | Stage | . | Pre-Production Testing (Laboratory) | Calibration Test | 1 | . | Accuracy Percentage Test | 1 | . | Post-Production Testing (On-Site) | On-Site Calibration Test | 2 | . | Real-time Testing (On-Site) | Message Syntax Check | 3 | . | Gross Range Test | 3 | . | Spike Test | 3 | . | Noise Test | 3 | . | Rate of change test | 3 | . | Flat Line Test | 3 | . | Neighbor Sensor Test | 3 | . ### 4.2 Flood Sensors QC Test Descriptions #### 4.2.1 Pre-Production testing (Laboratory) ##### Noise floor Test ##### Accuracy Percentage Check ##### Calibration Test #### 4.2.2 Post-Production testing (On-Site) ##### Baseline Calibration Test #### 4.2.3 Real-time Testing (On-Site) ##### 4.2.3.1 Payload Message Syntax Check LoRaWAN MAC and application messages are origin-authenticated, integrity-protected and encrypted end-to-end (i.e., from end device to the application server and vice versa) [Reference 6](https://lora-developers.semtech.com/uploads/documents/files/LoRaWAN_Class_A_Devices_In_Depth_Downloadable.pdf). The received message is in the form of a payload, and this full message contains the same structure that the sensor prepares and sends an uplink payload. There are two possible conditions of a received payload: | No | Condition | Result | Action | . | 1 | Complete Payload message | Successful Uplink | Passed | . | 2 | Null Payload message | Failed Uplink | Discarded | . These zero payloads are rarely seen with the use of accurate LoRaWAN protocol timing implementation. Upon receiving a successful uplink on the TTN Console, which can be verified by the payload size, the payload bytes are decoded based on the fixed payload structures the end-devices are programmed to transmit. Every time when the configuration of the sensor has been updated (duty cycle, change of Application, reset, modes of operation etc), the sensor transmits the new configuration as the next uplink message. All the other times, the sensor periodically transmits the sensor reading as the uplink message. Hence there are two possible payload structures an end-device can transmit and the following are their structures: **Sensor Reading payload format:** | Error flags | Sensor Mode | Sensor Sampling Rate | Sensor Number of Readings | . | 1 byte : 255 or 0xFF | 1 byte | 2 bytes | 1 bytes | . ##### **Sensor Configuration payload format:** | Error flags | Battery Level | Ultrasonic reading | . | 1 byte | 2 bytes | 2 bytes | . ##### Spike Test ##### Statistical test ##### Baseline Offset Test **Gross Range Check** ##### Erroneous depth range Test ### 4.3 Examples of QC Tests Applications ## References 1.

Gather the PCB and a multimeter to check the PCB for any manufacturing defects. To perform the PCB fault check, place one probe on the beginning of the trace and the other on the ending and check for any short circuits like shown in figure 1. Repeat this process for every trace. 2. While placing the PCB upside down, Solder a 2-pin JST connector into the Battery IN like shown in figure 2. Note: All the holes of the screw terminal shall be facing the print on the PCB like shown in figure 2. 3. Now with PCB in the same position, solder the three legs of the slide switch into the ON OFF pins like shown below in figure 3 (There are a total of 5 legs on this components and the legs on the either ends need not to be soldered, i.e. the middle three are the ones that need soldering). The switch does not have polarity but just on and off depending on where the slider lies. 4. Turn the PCB around and make sure the switch is turned of like shown in figure 4. 5. Now with the PCB placed upside down, solder screw terminals for Ultrasonic Sensor and Solar input like shown in the figure 5. 6. Now Solder battery out screw terminals into BAT OUT like shown in figure 6. 7. Using a multimeter check for shorts and connectivity like shown in figure 7. Further quality of the soldering shall be checked at this step and [identify and resolve any soldering errors](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering?view=all#common-problems). ### Stage 2 - MCU Assembly 1. Prepare a 2 Pin JST connector by tanning the other ends. Then, insert the JST 2 pin connecter on the back side of MCU like shown below in figure 8. 2. Now cut the MCU male headers to match the number of through holes on the PCB and the female header pins like shown in the below figure 9. 3. Mount the MCU male headers into female headers like shown in the figure 10 below. 4. Solder MCU header pins on the top of the MCU while the MCU is securely held by the female header pins on the bottom like shown in figure 11. 5. With the PCB upside down solder the female header pins into the PCB like shown below in figure 12. 6. Now, connect the 2 ends of the JST connector from the MCU with the BAT OUT into their corresponding terminals VB and G respectively like shown in the figure 13 below. 7. Using a multimeter check for the connectivity between the MCU pins and the screw terminals. ### Stage 3 - Battery Assembly 1. Remove the MCU from the female header pins and insert a ***fully charged*** 400mAh battery into the BAT IN and secure the battery by using a tape like shown in the figure 14 below. 2. Mount the MCU back onto the headers and make sure the battery is not under pressure or being crushed by the MCU. When the battery and MCU are looking like figure 15, there must be enough space between the MCU and battery. ### Evaluation 1 - Main voltage check 1. Turn on the switch and check the voltage at BAT OUT. The multimeter reading should be VBat - the battery's voltage level, across VB and GND when the s/w is on like shown below in figure 15. 2. Turn off the switch before proceeding to next steps - figure 16. ### Stage 4 - Housing Preperation Instruction on using the step drill, jigs, and other tools {Fill-me-in} 1. Secure the lid of the housing and place a marker right on the center using a ultrasonic-jig. Remove the ultrasonic-jig and drill a hole of diameter {fill-me-in} to accommodate the Ultrasonic sensor like shown in figure 17. 2. Secure the housing with the side that does not have mounting supports facing upwards. Place a marker using the antenna-jig. Remove the antenna-jig and drill a hole of diameter {fill-me-in} to accommodate the antenna like shown in figure 18. 3. Similarly, on the opposite side where there is no mounting support, drill a hole of diameter {fill-me-in} using the pg5-cable-jig to accommodate the solar panel cable like shown in figure 19. ### Stage 5 - Ultrasonic Sensor Assembly 1. Tan both ends of 4 different colored wires and solder one end of the wires onto the Ultrasonic sensor's pins - GND, V+, 5 and 4 respectively like shown in figure 20. 2. Now twist the cables like shown below in figure 21. 3. Check for connectivity and any [common soldering errors](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering?view=all#common-problems). 4. Stack 2 washers that come with the lock nut like shown below in figure 22. 5. Insert US into the housing lid secure it using a lock nut on the inside of the housing lid like shown in figure 23. ### Stage 6 - PCB Mounting 1. Lift the MCU and screw the PCB onto the mounting headers on the base of the housing. The orientation shall match the one shown in the figure 24. 2. Insert the MCU back into the header pins ### Stage 7 - Solar Panel Assembly 1. Use a {fill-me-in} wire and cut it to a length of {fill-me-in} like shown in the figure 25. 2. Prepare the ends by tinning them like shown in the figure 26. 3. Place the nut of the PG-7 cable gland inside the housing and insert this prepared end of the wire into the hosuing through a PG-7 cable gland like shown in the figure 27. 4. Screw in the ends into the Solar screw terminals into the respective pins like shown in figure 28. 5. Stick one side of the gasket onto the 3d mount and run the other end of the solar cable through the 3d mount like shown in figure 29. Leave enough space for soldering the solar panel. 6. Now, prepare the ends by stripping the wires and tinning them and solder the ends onto the Solar board like shown in figure 30. 7. Screw the open ends of the solar cable into the screw terminal SOLAR through the cable gland and check connectivity between the solar panel and screw terminals like shown in figure 31. ### Evaluation 2 - Solar Panel Operation 1. Check for connectivity between both the ends of the solar cable. Also check for shorts between the VS and GND {figure 32} 2. Flash light onto the solar panel and check voltages on the screw terminals using a multimeter like shown below. When a phone falshlight is flashed upon the panel, it should read atleast 3 Volts. {figure 33} 2. Now with the light is being flashed onto the panel, verify the VS is the positive terminal. If not, the solar panel has been soldered in reverse and shall be re-soldered so that a positive voltage is seen on the VS. {figure 34} ### Stage 8 - Antenna Assembly 1. Stack a star washer and lock washer and insert the end of the antenna with threading into the housing from the inside like shown in the figure 35 2. Secure it using a screw from the outside like shown in figure 36 3. Insert the ulf connector of the antenna onto the MCU like shown in figure 37. 4. Screw in the LoRa Antenna from the outside like shown in the figure 38. The antenna should feel tight after screwing onto the threading. If not, try washers of different size. ### Evaluation 3 - Sensor Operation 1. Flash the test firmware and check the battery voltage and ultrasonic measurements on TTN console. The battery voltage shall be between 3.7 Volts and 4.2 Volts. Since we would be using a fully charged battery, it should read voltage greater than 4 Volts. The distance reading on the TTN console shall be greater than or equal to 300 and less than or equal to the maximum range of the sensor model. The 5-meter model range is 300mm to 5000mm and the 10-meter model range is 300mm to 10000mm. {figure 39} ### Final steps 1. Close the lid and make sure the ultrasonic sensor wires goes to the {} to avoid the wires being in the way. {figure 40} 2. Now secure the lid with screws {figure 41} 3. The sensor shall feel robust and when invereted there shall be no moving parts. 4. Inspect the sensor mechanical quality of the following: holes, mounts, securing enclosure, waterproofing. {figure 42} 5. Remove the tape on the gasket and install the solar panel onto the 3D mount {figure 43} ## References 1. [*ER Quality Program Plan*, ES/*ER*/TM-4/R4.
