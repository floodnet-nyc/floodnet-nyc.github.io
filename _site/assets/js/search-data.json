The data and knowledge gained can be used by local residents, researchers, city agencies, and others to advocate around and work to reduce flood risk. FloodNet brings together innovative sources of information on street flooding impacts in neighborhoods that are vulnerable to high tides, storm surge, and stormwater runoff. ",

    "content": "Of the myriad impacts that are predicted to accompany climate change, flooding is expected to have an out-sized influence on public health, infrastructure, and mobility in urban areas. In New York City, for example, sea level rise and an increase in the occurrence of high intensity rain storms (which convey large volumes of water to drains, leading to backups and overflows) have led to a dramatic increase in flood risk, particularly in low-lying and coastal neighborhoods. The physical presence of standing water on streets and sidewalks can impede mobility and restrict access to transportation. Additionally, urban flood water contains a diverse array of contaminants, including industrial and household chemicals, fuels, and sewage. Access to real-time information on flooding can improve resiliency and efficiency by allowing residents to identify navigable transportation routes and make informed decisions to avoid exposure to floodwater contaminants.

This platform includes a physical sensor network, its connectivity, as well as data storage, and sharing infrastructure. ",

This document details the responsibilities of the Quality Assurance personnel and chain of command for executing the QAP. **Table of Contents:** * [General](#general) * [Purpose](#purpose) * [Scope](#scope) * [Roles and Responsibilities](#roles-and-responsibilities) * [Training](#training) * [Training Needs](#training-needs) * [Training Program Implementation](#training-program-implementation) * [Quality Assurance Process](#quality-assurance-process) * [Quality Requirements](#quality-requirements) * [Hardware](#hardware) * [Software](#software) * [Quality Assurance Stages with Evaluation](#quality-assurance-stages-with-evaluation) * [Quality Assurance Records](#quality-assurance-records) * [References](#references) ## General ### Purpose The main objectives of this document are: - Establish and execute Quality Assurance (QA) measures and procedures to meet high quality sensor standards - Provide Quality Control (QC) guidelines for fault identification and rectification, and quality evaluations. ### Scope This Quality Assurance Process (QAP) applies to all personnel performing sensor development, assembly and validation at FloodNet. ### Roles and Responsibilities The following table outlines the roles and responsibilities for FloodNet personnel | FloodNet personnel | QA Roles | QA Responsibilities | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | Technical Lead | 1. QA Manager/Advisor 2. Technical Lead | 1. Manages the project and oversees the big picture2. Uses strong technical skills to help the team solve technical issues | Sensor Engineer | 1. QA Team Test Lead 2. QA Validation Specialist 3. QA Manual/Automation Test Engineer | 1. Provides Leadership specifically to the test team to support the test teammates and oversee test processes 2. Participate in validation of the Quality Assurance Process (QAP) 3. Develop and maintain Manual/Automated test processes | Graduate Research Assistant | 1. QA Manual/Automation Test Analyst 2. QA Tester | 1. Develop, maintain and execute Manual/Automated test processes 2. Follow strict set of instructions to test or validate the product | ## Training ### Training Needs ### Training Program Implementation ## Quality Assurance Process The Quality Assurance Process shall be followed staff responsible for performing and verifying work affecting sensor quality. ### Quality Requirements The Quality Requirements are classified into two categories: Hardware and Software. QAP process shall be followed on the former first, followed by the later. Software malfunction could be a result of failures in the hardware. Hence, the *QA process shall be reinitiated from the beginning upon identification of bugs in either stages to follow the QAP pipeline.* #### Hardware The following is the list of hardware quality requirements: | Hardware Quality Requirements | Description | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | High Quality Electrical Connections | 1. The sensor's hardware must **NOT** have any errors in electrical connections.2. High quality soldering practices | Free of Short-Circuits | 1. The sensor shall have **NO** short-circuits2. The personnel shall check for short-circuits at every stage of the assembly | Desired Hardware operation | 1. The sensor Hardware shall be functional and tested before moving onto the software stage | Waterproofed Sensor | 1. All the electrical wire connections lying **inside** as well as **outside** of the sensor shall be waterproofed using heat shrink tubing2. All the external cables and electrical connections outside the sensor shall be waterproofed further either by using liquid electrical tape or silicon3.
