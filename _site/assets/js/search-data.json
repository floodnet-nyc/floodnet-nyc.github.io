    "content": "Of the myriad impacts that are predicted to accompany climate change, flooding is expected to have an out-sized influence on public health, infrastructure, and mobility in urban areas. In New York City, for example, sea level rise and an increase in the occurrence of high intensity rain storms (which convey large volumes of water to drains, leading to backups and overflows) have led to a dramatic increase in flood risk, particularly in low-lying and coastal neighborhoods. The physical presence of standing water on streets and sidewalks can impede mobility and restrict access to transportation. Additionally, urban flood water contains a diverse array of contaminants, including industrial and household chemicals, fuels, and sewage. Access to real-time information on flooding can improve resiliency and efficiency by allowing residents to identify navigable transportation routes and make informed decisions to avoid exposure to floodwater contaminants.

    "content": "The QAP shall be followed by all the personnel responsible for performing and verifying work affecting sensor quality. Stage 1 - Housing Preparation . Instructions on using the step drill are here . | Secure the housing lid using a vice and drill a hole of diameter 1 1/4”. The hole in the lid shall be able accommodate the Ultrasonic sensor. | Similarly using a step drill and a vice, on the sides with no mounting support, drill a hole of diameter 1/2” on one side and 1/4” on the other side. | . Stage 2 - PCB Assembly . | Gather a multimeter and check the PCB for any manufacturing defects. Choose the continuity setting on the multimeter indicated by a small microphone symbol. To perform the PCB fault check, place one probe on the beginning of the trace and the other on the ending and check for connectivity as shown in the figure below. Repeat this process for every trace. The both ends of a trace shall have connectivity. Across different traces, continuity shall not be observed unless they share the common pin like GND or V+. | While placing the PCB upside down, Solder a 2-pin JST connector into the Battery IN facing towards the center of the board. | Now with PCB in the same position, solder the three legs of the slide switch into the ON OFF pins like shown below (There are a total of 5 legs on this components and the legs on the either ends need not to be soldered, i.e. the middle three are the ones that need soldering). The switch does not have polarity but just on and off depending on where the slider lies. | Turn the PCB around and make sure the switch is turned off. | Now with the PCB placed upside down, solder screw terminals for Ultrasonic Sensor and Solar input like shown below. Note: All the holes of the screw terminal shall be facing the text on the PCB like shown in above figures. | Now Solder battery out screw terminals into BAT OUT like below. | Using a multimeter check for shorts and connectivity. Further quality of the soldering shall be checked at this step and identify and resolve any soldering errors. | . Stage 3 - MCU Assembly . | Now cut the MCU male headers to match the 8-pin female headers as shown in the below figure. | Insert these male headers into female headers and place the MCU’s first eight pins, both sides on top of these male headers. Solder header pins while the MCU is securely held by the female header pins, as shown in the figure below. | With the PCB upside down solder the female header pins into the PCB like shown below. Make sure PCB is facing the right direction and inserted into the correct pins. | Using a multimeter check for the connectivity between the MCU pins and the screw terminals. | . Stage 4 - Battery Assembly . | With the switch turned off, remove the MCU from the female header pins and insert a fully charged 400 mAh battery into the BAT IN. | Prepare a 2 Pin JST connector by tanning the other ends. Insert the connecter on the back side of MCU as shown below. | Connect the JST connector with BAT OUT into their corresponding VB and G, respectively, as shown below. | Mount the MCU back onto the headers and make sure the battery is not under any pressure or being crushed by the MCU. When done correctly battery should be only held by the JST connector and sits comfortably under the MCU. | . Evaluation 1 - Main voltage check . | Turn on the switch and check the voltage at BAT OUT. The multimeter reading should be VBat - the battery’s voltage level, across VB and GND when the s/w is on. | Turn off the switch before proceeding to next steps when the evaluation has been successfully completed. | . Stage 5 - Ultrasonic Sensor Assembly . | Tan both ends of 4 different colored wires and solder one end of the wires onto the Ultrasonic sensor’s pins - GND, V+, 5 and 4. | Carefully, without applying too much pressure on the solder joints, twist them like shown. | Check for connectivity and any common soldering errors. | Stack 2 washers that come with the lock nut like shown below. | Insert US into the housing lid secure it using a lock nut on the inside of the housing lid. | Connect V+ of ultrasonic sensor to the VE of PCB. Connect GND of ultrasonic sensor to the G of PCB. Connect pin 4 of ultrasonic sensor to the G5 of PCB. Connect pin 5 of ultrasonic sensor to the RX of PCB. | . Stage 6 - PCB Mounting and Antenna Assembly . | Using a plier, cut the legs on the bottom of the soldered PCB to save some room. | Connect the MHF4 female to the MCU and secure SMA female end into the housing using a nut. | Insert the PCB into the housing by sliding it under the antenna like shown. | Lift the MCU and screw the PCB onto the mounting headers on the base of the housing. The orientation shall match the housing holes: 1/2” hole shall be facing the solar input. | Insert the MCU back into the header pins and screw the other end of the PCB into the housing. | Screw in a male LoRa antenna (should support 915 MHz) onto the SMA female connector. | . Stage 7 - Solar Panel Assembly . | Cut an alarm cable or 2 conductor wire to a length of 30cm or 12 inches. Prepare the ends by tinning them. Note: Adjust the length so that cable can reach from the sensor to the panel based on the chosen mount. | Stick one side of the gasket onto the 3D-mount and run one end of the solar cable through the 3D-mount like shown. | Solder the panel to this end that runs through the 3D-mount and gasket. | Seal the panel using the gasket. | Place the nut of the PG-7 cable gland inside the housing and insert the other prepared end of the solar cable into the housing through a PG-7 cable gland. | Screw the open ends of the solar cable into the screw terminal SOLAR. Secure the cable gland. | . Evaluation 2 - Solar Panel Operation . | Check for connectivity between both the ends of the solar cable. Also check for shorts between the VS and GND. | Flash light onto the solar panel and check voltages on the screw terminals using a multimeter. When a phone falshlight is flashed upon the panel, it should read atleast 3 Volts. | Now with the light is being flashed onto the panel, verify the VS is the positive terminal. If not, the solar panel has been soldered in reverse and shall be re-soldered so that a positive voltage is seen across VS and GND. | . Evaluation 3 - Sensor Operation . | Flash the test firmware and check the battery voltage and ultrasonic measurements on TTN console. The battery voltage shall be between 3.7 Volts and 4.2 Volts. Since we would be using a fully charged battery, it should read voltage greater than 4 Volts. The distance reading on the TTN console shall be greater than or equal to 300 and less than or equal to the maximum range of the sensor model. The 5-meter model range is 300mm to 5000mm and the 10-meter model range is 300mm to 10000mm. | . Final steps . | Close the lid and make sure the ultrasonic sensor wires goes into the space safely to avoid them being in the way. | Now secure the lid with screws | The sensor shall feel robust and when invereted there shall be no moving parts. | Inspect the sensor mechanical quality of the following: holes, mounts, securing enclosure, waterproofing. | .

A combination of docker containers is running a load-balanced web server (NGINX), certificate authority (LetsEncrypt), data routing layer (NodeRed), a database (InfluxDB), and a dashboard platform (Grafana). The data processing stage takes place on the Node-RED flow, where the raw distance measurements are converted into Flood Depth Data (FDD).

    "title": "3.2 Data Processing Methodology",
    "content": "This section explains the data processing methodology implemented in the real-time data pipeline to calculate depth values from the raw data. The following picture demonstrates the flow which every data packet passes through: . There are three main components where all these stages takes place: TTN Console, Node-Red and InfluxDB. The following sections explain these stages in detail. Message Syntax Check . Payload decoder has been implemented on the TTN console to verify and decode the raw payload of incoming messages from end-nodes. Distance to Depth Conversion . Raw measurements of the ultrasonic sensors are distances. Depth measurements are calculated with the application two transformations - Inversion followed by Offsetting. Inversion is multiplying the distance measurements with negative one. Offsetting is adding an offset value to the inverted measurements to obtain depth measurements. Raw distance measurements: . The following figure shows raw distance values of the sensor on Carroll and 4th from 20th August midnight to 22nd August 12:00 pm. Two floods have been captured during the night of 22nd and they correspond to the two spikes in the figure. Distance readings are usually the distance between the street sidewalk and the sensor installation height within the noise floor. From the figure it can be observed that this baseline or the most common values when there is no flood is 2.82 meters. But during the time of the flood, the water level is the new surface the sensor detects and as the water level increases upwards, the distance between the sensor and this new surface decreases. Therefore the spikes are downwards. Inversion: . As the water level increases during the flood, the distance readings between the sensor and this raising water level decreases. Thereby, inverting the measurements is more intuitive as the floods captured are now upwards and has the same profile as the actual flood. However these are not depth measurements yet as they are at an offset. Offsetting: . After inversion, an offset value is calculated and added to obtain depth values. This offset is calculated by using the median of the past 7 day’s stable data. Now the baseline when there is no flood is around 0 and the depths are above this baseline. Erroneous Depth Data Filter . The flood depth data is further filtered to remove noise without losing the important flood-data characteristics such as timing, duration, depth, and the flood profile. Data filtering involves the following steps: . | Gross Range Check: . The range of the raw distance measurements are based on the sensor model and its range. For example, 30mm - 5000 mm ranging sensor can only measure distances between these intervals. However, after installing the sensor at a known installation height, assuming the profile of the sidewalk’s surface is constant, this range now becomes 30mm - installation height. Hence any measurement outside this new range is discarded. | Spike Check: . Spikes in the depth data can be caused by external agents such as animals, humans or any other object large enough to be detected by the sensor. The sensor takes the median of 5 measurements for every uplink to minimize these spikes. Furthermore, the spikes leads to a different profile compared to that of flood and are omitted. For example, the alerting system calculates the rate of change of successive depth measurements. This rate of change of depth measurements is slow and different for a flood compared to that of any other object because a gradual raise of the water surface corresponds to a gradual increase in the depth measurements. Where as an external object causes a very large rate of change and the alerting system does not flag these measurements as a flood. | Noise Check: . Since the sensor working principle is based on the speed of the sound, the ultrasonic sensor measurements are influenced by the same factors - temperature, humidity, direct sunlight, wind etc that influence the speed of sound in air. This noise is around 1% of the measurement or 1 inch when installed at 2.5 meters. Due to solar radiation during the day, the temperature of the housing changes and the measured depth deviates from the actual depth by this noise floor. This deviation is caused by error in the temperature compensation. Therefore the depth measurements that lie within this noise floor are filtered out. | . Data Storage - InfluxDB . Every data passed through this pipeline is finally stored in InfluxDB database with a timestamp at which the data is logged. Offset Calculator . The raw distance data has anomalies during the daytime due to inaccurate temperature compensation of the sensor in direct sunlight. These anomalies are in the opposite direction of the depth measurements as shown in below figure . When converted to depth, these anomalies appear below the surface which the sensor is looking at. Since the sensor is usually mounted above the sidewalk, the actual distance between the sensor and the sidewalk is constant. Also, during the night times, these anomalies are not observed and sensors data is most stable. Every night at 11:30 pm, the offset is estimated for every sensor by calculating the median of last 7 days night time data. The following figure shows the transformed depth values . The depth values cannot be negative and they are further filtered to get more stable data in a no-flood condition and the following figure shows such transformation. ",
