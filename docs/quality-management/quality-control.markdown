## General 

### Purpose

Provide Quality Control (QC) guidelines for fault identification and rectification, and quality evaluations

### Scope

This Quality Control Procedure applies to all personnel performing sensor development, assembly and validation at FloodNet.

<h2>Quality Requirements</h2>

The following are the quality requirements of the Flood Sensor:

| Quality Requirements       | Description                                                  |
| :------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sensor Data Validation     |                                                              |
| Good Sensor Accuracy       |                                                              |
| Desired Sensor operation   | 1.  The sensor Hardware shall be functional and tested before moving onto the software stage |
| Weatherproofed Sensor      | 1. The sensor and it's housing shall be checked for any defects or potential damage that might cause failure in waterproofing |
| Good Wireless Connectivity | 1. Sensor tested on the Testing Application on the back-end<br />2. Good RSSI values for LoRa |
