# Quality Control

After the production/assembly stage, quality control (QC) tests are performed on every sensor to validate the data quality. QC testing is followed after Quality Assurance Procedure (QAP). QAP is a quality management procedure followed during the sensor build process, whereas QC procedures are performed after the complete build procedure and before the deployment.

## General 

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide Quality Control (QC) guidelines for 

- Sensor Calibration Testing and Validation
- Noise Floor Testing

## Quality Requirements

The following are the quality requirements of the Flood Sensor:

| Quality Requirements       | Description                                                  |
| :------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sensor Data Validation     |                                                              |
| Good Sensor Accuracy       |                                                              |
| Desired Sensor operation   | 1.  The sensor Hardware shall be functional and tested before moving onto the software stage |
| Weatherproofed Sensor      | 1. The sensor and it's housing shall be checked for any defects or potential damage that might cause failure in waterproofing |
| Good Wireless Connectivity | 1. Sensor tested on the Testing Application on the back-end<br />2. Good RSSI values for LoRa |
